## Introduction

We will be running the computer labs for the fisheries science module in
SCIE2204 online including video chat with me during the scheduled lab
times.

The lab schedule is as follows:

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream A: 31st March 9-11

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream B: 1 April 9-11

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream C: 3 April 14-16

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream A: 7 April 9-11

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream B: 8 April 9-11

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream C: 9 April 8-10 \*\*\*\*\*\*Note that
    this lab was rescheduled to avoid clash with Good Friday\!\!\!

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream c: 21 April 9-11

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream B: 22 April 9-11

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream C: 24 April 14-16

You have two options for completing the labs:

1.  You can log in to the video chat at YOUR scheduled lab time. DO NOT
    SWAP LAB TIMES\!\!\! If you really need to switch email me:
    <matthew.navarro@uwa.edu.au>

OR

2.  You can complete each lab in your own time after 4pm. BUT, do not
    leave it all to the end, as you will miss the assessment deadlines\!
    The 4pm thing may seem weird, but we are running the labs by
    remotely accessing computers in the Eastern states (we are cloud
    computing), and we do not want to overload them. By 4pm everyone in
    the East has finished work leaving more room for us.

Even if you chose te complete the lab in your own time you can get help
by starting a thread in the LMS Discussion Board. Please post under
‘Content Discussion’

Assessments for the labs will consist of three short multi-choice
quizzes, one for each lab. They should only take 5 minutes, so just
complete them immediately after you have completed the lab\! The quizzes
will be on LMS.

The quiz deadlines are as follows:

Lab 1 assessment: Due 12pm 9th April Lab 2 assessment: Due 12pm 16th
April Lab 3 assessment: Due 12pm 30th April

## Instructions for video chat during scheduled lab time

### The video chat will be hosted on zoom.

To acccess the video chat click on the zoom link corresponding to your
class:

  - Lab 1 Stream A: 31st March 9-11 <https://uwa.zoom.us/j/221032322>
  - Lab 1 Stream B: 1 April 9-11 <https://uwa.zoom.us/j/639202405>
  - Lab 1 Stream C: 3 April 14-16 <https://uwa.zoom.us/j/280318223>

(optional but recommended) It is best if you install zoom before the lab
as this will give you access to extra features. You can download zoom
from <https://zoom.us/download>

(optional) If you find yourself zooming a lot you can sign up for a uwa
zoom account which gives you access to even more features. Instructions
for doin this are at
<http://www.worldclasseducation.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/3446131/Zoom-Guide.pdf>

### Instructions for when in the zoom meeting

We will potentially have 25 students logged in at once. To make things
manageable we need to follow a few guidelines:

1.  In general please keep your microphone muted (this is in the bottom
    left corner). You can have video on or off - it’s up to you
2.  If you want to ask a question click on Participants in the centre
    and then click raise hand
3.  When i’m up to you i will say your name. Unmute your microphone and
    ask your question. Note than you will be able to hear everyone elses
    questions and my responses.
4.  You can also use the chat feature to ask questions. I will try and
    keep an eye on it, but i may miss your question. If i do just raise
    your hand.
5.  At some point i may ask you to share your screen with me. You can do
    this by clicking the share button.

In general zoom works best when you have a reasonable internet
connection. It will work on a mobile hostpot also. If you do not have
access to a reasonable internet connection, and you need help with the
exercises, you can still access campus libraries - atleast for now.
Alternatively send me an email.
